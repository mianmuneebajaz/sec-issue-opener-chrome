## üîê Permission Justifications

### Tabs Permission

Our extension requires the `tabs` permission to open new tabs with the generated URLs. When you enter a value and submit the form, we need this permission to create a new tab with your dynamically constructed URL.

### Active Tab Permission

The `activeTab` permission is used to focus the newly created tab after navigation. This provides a seamless user experience by automatically bringing your generated URL to focus after creation.

### Storage Permission

We use the `storage` permission to save your customized URL templates and extension preferences locally. This ensures your configuration persists between browser sessions without requiring you to reconfigure the extension each time.
